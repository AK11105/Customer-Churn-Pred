## 📊 Comprehensive Evaluation Strategy:

For business-critical churn prediction, we need multiple evaluation perspectives:

**🎯 Business-Focused Metrics:**
- **Precision**: Of customers we predict will churn, how many actually do? (Cost of retention campaigns)
- **Recall**: Of customers who actually churn, how many do we catch? (Revenue preservation)
- **F1-Score**: Balanced measure for imbalanced datasets
- **ROC-AUC**: Overall discriminative ability across all thresholds

**💰 Financial Impact Analysis:**
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: ROI of retention campaigns
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Impact of preventing churn
- **Threshold Optimization**: Balance precision vs recall for business objectives

**🔍 Model Interpretability:**
- **Feature Importance**: Which factors drive churn most?
- **Prediction Confidence**: Risk-based customer segmentation
- **Error Analysis**: Understanding model limitations
