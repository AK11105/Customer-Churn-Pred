### **7.2 Prediction Confidence Scores and Decision Thresholds**

In customer churn prediction, the raw probability output from a model requires careful interpretation to translate into business actions. Confidence scores and calibrated decision thresholds provide the framework for operationalizing model predictions.

**Academic Foundations:**

The raw output from a neural network's sigmoid function represents an uncalibrated probability estimate. For decision-making purposes, these estimates must be:

1. **Calibrated**: Ensuring probability estimates match empirical frequencies
2. **Contextualized**: Mapped to business-relevant decision thresholds
3. **Confidence-Scored**: Augmented with certainty measurements

**Confidence Score Framework:**

| Probability Range | Confidence Level | Recommended Action | Business Priority |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 0.0 - 0.2        | Very Low Risk    | Standard Service   | Low              |
| 0.2 - 0.4        | Low Risk         | Periodic Monitoring| Low-Medium       |
| 0.4 - 0.6        | Uncertain        | Enhanced Monitoring| Medium           |
| 0.6 - 0.8        | High Risk        | Targeted Offers    | High             |
| 0.8 - 1.0        | Very High Risk   | Immediate Intervention | Critical      |

**Theoretical Considerations:**

* **Platt Scaling**: Logistic regression on model outputs for improved calibration
* **Isotonic Regression**: Non-parametric approach to probability calibration
* **Conformal Prediction**: Providing statistical guarantees on prediction sets
* **Cost-Sensitive Decision Theory**: Optimal thresholds based on misclassification costs

**Business Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Different thresholds for different customer segments
2. **Risk-Based Resource Allocation**: Intervention resources proportional to risk scores
3. **Confidence-Based Communication**: Providing confidence intervals to business stakeholders
4. **ROI-Optimized Targeting**: Thresholds that maximize expected retention campaign ROI
