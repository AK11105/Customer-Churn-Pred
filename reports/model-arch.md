# 🧠 Model Design Strategy:**

For customer churn prediction, we'll design a deep neural network optimized for:
- **Binary Classification**: Churn vs No-Churn prediction
- **Imbalanced Data**: Using weighted loss and appropriate metrics
- **Feature Interactions**: Multiple hidden layers to capture complex patterns
- **Regularization**: Dropout and batch normalization for better generalization
- **Business Interpretation**: Model explanability for actionable insights

**🏗️ Architecture Components:**
- **Input Layer**: All engineered features
- **Hidden Layers**: Progressive dimension reduction with ReLU activation
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting (0.3 dropout rate)
- **Batch Normalization**: Stable training and faster convergence
- **Output Layer**: Single neuron with sigmoid for probability output

**📊 Training Strategy:**
- **Loss Function**: Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (handles class imbalance)
- **Optimizer**: Adam with learning rate scheduling
- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC (business-focused)
- **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting based on validation loss
